# Course content
The field of machine learning is devoted to building methods that identify patterns in data, in order to make automated predictions or decisions.

Machine learning is becoming an increasingly important method in psychology as datasets increase in size and complexity, e.g., data from registers or brain imaging. The goal of this course is to give PhD students an introduction to machine learning that will enable them to apply these tools in their own research, and to further navigate the literature. The lectures will cover core concepts and give an overview of different methods suitable to different research problems. Through practical exercises, students will get introduced to important software packages like keras and xgboost. The students can choose between using R or Python for the practical exercises.
