The function should call the 'fit_and_predict_standardized' function to retrieve out-of-sample predictions for the validation set. Based on these and the ground truth labels in the validation set, it should compute and return the AUC. Test the function using the train and test set from above, while standardizing the 'Age', 'RestBP' and 'Chol' variables (and including the remaining predictors). Print the AUC."
