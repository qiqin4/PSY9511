    "The task is as follows:\n",
    "- Download the Credit.csv dataset from ISL: https://www.statlearning.com/s/Credit.csv\n",
    "- Preprocess the dataset as you see fit.\n",
    "- Fit non-linear models (GLM, GAM, RF, XGBoost) to predict Balance from the other variables in the dataset. You are not allowed to use the Income variable as a predictor, due to its high collinearity with Balance. Whether you fit one or more types of models is up to you, the same goes for the choice of hyperparameters and how you find them. However, you should aim for achieving good predictive performance, and being relatively certain the performance holds up in new data. In other words, using a train/validation/test-split or a (nested) cross-validation is probably a good idea. When you are satisfied, report model performance in a comprehensible manner.\n",
    "- Reflect on the choices you made: Why did you choose the model(s) you did? What about the hyperparameters? How did you tune them?\n",
    "- Reflect upon the performance of the model(s): How well did it/they perform? What would you expect the performance to be on new data? How can you argue this is the case? What other choices could have made you more or less certain about this?"
