# Using ChatGPT

Do it!

But you will be asked to explain your results.
ChatGPT can be very useful for explaining code, or explaining a concept a bit differently. Example prompts.

> You are an expert in Bayesian statistics and are particularily influenced by Statistician Andrew Gelman and Richard McElreaths book "statistical rethinking. Please explain the concept of a prior predictive check.

> Explain the following equation: Pr(W, L, p) = Pr(W, L|p) Pr(p)

> Show a linear regression formulated in ulam from the R package rethinking.

> explain this code from the solutions to excercises of the book "Statistical Rethinking":

```{r}
#| eval: false
m <- quap(
  alist(
    height ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + b*( weight - xbar ) ,
    a ~ dnorm( 178 , 20 ) ,
    b ~ dlnorm( 0 , 1 ) ,
    sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 50 )
  ) , data=d2 )

```

Use chatGPT as tutor, not as a fast way to complete exercises.
